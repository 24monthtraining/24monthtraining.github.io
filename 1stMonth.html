							<h1>1st Month Details of 24 Months Training</h1>
							<h2>Day 1:</h2>
							<p class="major"><!--[-->The first day has always been a bit challenging. 
								Even waking up was slightly hard. I set my alarm for 4:45 AM but ended up snoozing it 
								and woke up at 5:03 AM. After waking up, I made my bed and cleaned my room. 
								Then I went for a run — I usually run once a week, so it wasn’t too difficult. 
								After that, I came back, cooked my own breakfast, freshened up, and headed to the university.
								At first, I tried to focus on my studies but couldn’t concentrate well, so I meditated for a 
								while and listened to some music. That helped me get back into study mode. 
								In the afternoon, I returned to my room, had lunch, and took a short nap. 
								Later, I studied for more than 4 hours, making it a total of about 6.3 hours of study time for the day.<!--]--></p>
